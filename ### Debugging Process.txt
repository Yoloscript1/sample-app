### Debugging Process

**Issue Identified:**
- The `Counter` component was not incrementing the count as expected.

**Diagnosis:**
- Inspected the `Counter` component in React Developer Tools.
- Found that the `setCount` function was not updating the state correctly.

**Solution:**
- Updated the `onClick` handler to correctly modify the state using a callback:
  ```javascript
  <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>Increment</button>
